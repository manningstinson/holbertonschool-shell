# Holbertonschool | Shell Project

This is a read me file for Holberton School (holbertonschool-shell) permissions project.

For future reference, and to assist in my learning I have put together a google sheet.  This google sheet contains the scripts I used, descirptions, and project task reference. I have made the file available for viewing using the below link. This spreadsheet will get updated as the course/projects progress.

You can view it here.

I have duplicated these same notes, in both the project root folder (holbertonschool-shell), and sub-directories  basics, and permissions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!  :-)
